Gawk iPhone App for iOS4 and higher.
===

> Gawk - Inspired by a digital art exhibit, Decode at the Victoria & Albert, it is a grid of short looping silent 
> videos captured by various video capture devices.

With the recent rise in bundled video camera ready devices including PCs, laptops, and phones it was now possible to 
make a web app involving video as the primary input device. The Gawk Wall is a grid of short video clips uploaded by 
public users. Any user can create their own wall that they can share to friends, co-workers and family to contribute on.
Scenarios of usage are communities and organisations having their own walls, such as employees from work, or a wall 
filled with wedding guests.
